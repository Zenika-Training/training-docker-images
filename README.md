In trainings, we used some of the following images:

- [`zenika/k8s-training-deploy`](k8s-training-deploy/): image of an HTTP server that returns its version, used for labs on Deployments
- [`zenika/k8s-training-tools`](k8s-training-tools/): Debian-based image that embeds the necessary tools for labs such as the `curl`, `dnsutils`, `httping`, `procps`, `kubectl`, `jwt-cli`
- [`zenika/k8s-training-stress`](k8s-training-stress/): image of a binary to consume memory or CPU.
